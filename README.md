## Room for Improvement
While the Translation App provides basic functionality for translating text, there are several areas that could be improved:

1. **Error Handling**: The app currently lacks robust error handling mechanisms. It would be beneficial to implement proper error handling to handle cases such as invalid input, network errors, and API failures. This would enhance the overall user experience and make the app more reliable.
2. **User Registration and Authentication**: The app does not currently have user registration and authentication features. Adding these functionalities would allow users to have personalized translation histories, preferences, and settings.
3. **Improved GUI**: The current version of the app primarily focuses on command-line interactions. Enhancing the graphical user interface (GUI) would result in a more user-friendly and visually appealing application.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Depending on the size of the text being translated and the number of requests made, the app's performance could be improved. Implementing optimizations such as batch translations and asynchronous requests could enhance the app's speed and efficiency.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Depending on the size of the text being translated and the number of requests made, the app's performance could be improved. Implementing optimizations such as batch translations and asynchronous requests could enhance the app's speed and efficiency.

Here are some ideas for future development and enhancements:

1. **Language Detection**: Though embedded language detection functionality to automatically identify the source language. We haven't show it explicitly in the gui.
2. **Additional Translation Services**: Integrate additional translation services and APIs to provide users with more options and improve translation accuracy. This could include services like Google Translate or Microsoft Translator.
3. **Language Support**: Expand the language support of the app to include a wider range of languages. This would enable users to translate text in various languages, catering to a more diverse user base.
4. **Caching and Offline Support**: Implement caching mechanisms to store translations locally and provide offline support. This would be useful in scenarios where an internet connection is unavailable or unreliable.
5. **Notification System**: Introduce a notification system to notify users of completed translations, errors, or other relevant events. This could be done through emails, push notifications, or in-app notifications.
